\section{Introduction}

In what follows we shall make a short presentation regarding the following aspects related with wireless sensor networks, and applicable in the context of our project:

\begin{itemize}
	\item we shall tacle the issues regarding the architectural models and interaction paradigms used in sensor networks;
	\item we describe (one of the few) protocol that addresses the practical issues of communication, meaning the packing and flow of messages exchanged between the different actors; (this is at the application layer in the OSI model;)
	\item (step downwards to the transport / network) as we make an overview related with existing network stacks in two of the most known operating systems (targeting sensor networks): Contiky and TinyOS;
\end{itemize}
